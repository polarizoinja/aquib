                <p>
                  AL-HALAL Foods was founded in 2010 with a simple mission: to provide restaurants with the highest quality halal chicken and poultry products while maintaining strict adherence to Islamic dietary laws and food safety standards.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What began as a small family business has grown into a trusted supplier for hundreds of restaurants across the region. Our commitment to quality, authenticity, and customer service has been the cornerstone of our growth and success.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today, we continue to uphold the same values that guided us from the start. We work directly with certified halal farms to ensure that every product we offer meets our rigorous standards for quality, freshness, and halal compliance.

                  Our chicken is halal certified according to Islamic dietary laws. This means that the animals are raised in humane conditions, slaughtered by a Muslim with a prayer (tasmiya), and the blood is fully drained from the animal. Our entire process is regularly inspected and certified by recognized Islamic authorities.
